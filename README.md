## How its made ðŸ”¨

The express server uses a remote mongoDB database to hold users admins timecards jobsites and information needed for account creation and account recovery. The express server checks for auth, creates updates and deletes request data as needed.
The react frontend displays, creates, and searches for jobsites, timecards. The redux statemanagment keeps track of different sets of jobsites and timecards for easyer understanding and look ups.

## New Technologies ðŸ’»

I delved into the world of code quality by integrating ESLint into my workflow. Utilize ESLint strengthened my understanding of coding standards and provided a powerful mechanism for identifying and rectifying potential issues early in the development process.

## Lessons Learned ðŸ’¡

I acquired valuable insights into optimizing the structure of my Redux code. The challenge of efficiently loading and updating many sets of data of the same type prompted me to rethink and refine my approach to state management.

## Minor things that could be improved ðŸ”¸

Photos could be included for each jobsite, either routed through the server and held on an image hosting or images could be stored on the server host (require server memory to be dynamic resizing)

## Major things that could be improved ðŸ”¶

The back end could be transformed into a set of serverless functions for more module deployment. The front end could transformed into a server side rendering app to allow better web crawlers/SEO
